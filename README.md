## Well It's Optimized

This modpack does not try to give the most amount of fps possible.
But rather tries to have stable gameplay.
Currently It does not include much work.Just some basic config editing with some personal preferences.
But it should be good to go.

Use [This website](https://jamie.codeberg.page/mrpack-to-zip/@master/) for converting mrpacks into zips that includes all the mods.

Use [These patches](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/tree/pojav/PojavLauncher/1.19.4/config) for running on pojav. Dont worry these should work regardless of the minecraft version.
