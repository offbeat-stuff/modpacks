## Well It's Optimized

This modpack does not try to give the most amount of fps possible.
But rather tries to have stable gameplay.
Currently It does not include much work.Just some basic config editing with some personal preferences.
But it should be good to go.

Use [This website](https://jamie.codeberg.page/mrpack-to-zip/@master/) for converting mrpacks into zips that includes all the mods.

Use [These patches](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/tree/pojav/PojavLauncher/1.19.4/config) for running on pojav. Dont worry these should work regardless of the minecraft version.

This modpack can maintain 30 fps at 42 render distance when looking at all the chunks.
and 60 fps comfortably while just running around.
This modpack uses 1500 mb ram with 800 mb overhead for running at 42 chunks.
Note: This would probably freeze if you went straight into a 42 rd world. I eased slowly into 42 rd starting from 5 rd.
